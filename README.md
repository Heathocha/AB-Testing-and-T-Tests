Find the t-values to test understanding for the following items:

STEPS:
1.  Take the difference of the means by subtracting your means (example:  5 - 8 = -3)
2.  Square the variations and then divide over the size (for each input)
-  Example:  3*3 = 9/200 = .005
3.  Add the variations/size entries (example:  .005 + .018 = .023)
4.  Take the square root of the answer for the bottom (example:  square root of .023 = .15165)
5.  Divide the top (-3) by the bottom (.15165) = the t-value -19.7814

NOTE:  
- Summary of Central Tendency are the Means (y)
- Variations are the Standard Deviations (s)
- Size is the sample size for groups (N)

Problem #1:
- Mean:  5 and 8
- Variation:  1 and 3
- Size 200 and 500
Answer = -19.7814

Problem #2:
- Mean:  1090 and 999
- Variation:  400 and 30
- Size:  900 and 100
Answer:  6.6585


Problem #3:
- Mean:  45 and 40
- Variation:  45 and 40
- Size:  2000 and 2000
Answer:  3.7139

NOTE:  The difference in means (top) divided by the bottom (variablity over sample size) gives us the relative size of the different in means given the amount of noise in the data - this is the t-value.

Larger t-values mean the difference between means and variability is less likely due to noise.
